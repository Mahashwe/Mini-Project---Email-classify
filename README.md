# Mini-Project---Email-classify

Email Classification Project - Readme
Project Overview
This project is focused on classifying emails as "ham" or "spam" using a machine learning model. The goal is to preprocess the email text data, convert it into numerical features (vectors), and train a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam or ham.

Steps and Concepts Covered
Dataset Loading and Exploration:

We use the pandas library to load and explore the email dataset stored in a CSV file.
The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
We check for missing values using df.isnull().sum().
Text Vectorization:

We convert the raw text data (email content) into numerical features using Bag of Words (BOW).
The CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text is used to convert the text into vectors.
The vectorizer learns the vocabulary from the training data and transforms the text into a matrix of token counts.
Data Splitting:

We split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
This ensures that 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing.
Model Training:

We use Logistic Regression (from sklearn.linear_model) to classify the emails as spam or ham.
The model is trained using the training data (x_train, y_train).
Predictions are made on the test set (x_test).
Model Evaluation:

We evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, which is calculated with accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.
Accuracy represents the percentage of correctly classified emails.
User Input:

The project allows a user to input their own email, which is then classified as either spam or ham.
The email input is transformed using the same vectorizer and passed into the trained model for prediction.
Questions, Errors, and Solutions
1. Q: What does pd.read_csv() do?
A: It loads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, making it easier to work with the data in Python.
2. Q: Why use CountVectorizer and how does it work?
A: CountVectorizer is used to convert the text data into numerical features by creating a Bag of Words (BOW) representation. It tokenizes the email messages and counts the frequency of each word in the text.
3. Q: What is the difference between fit_transform() and transform()?
A: fit_transform() is used to learn the vocabulary from the training data and then transform it into vectors. transform() is used to apply the learned vocabulary to new data (e.g., user input) without altering the model's vocabulary.
4. Q: What is train_test_split and why is it used?
A: train_test_split is used to split the data into training and testing sets. This ensures the model is trained on one part of the data and evaluated on a separate part, avoiding overfitting.
5. Q: Why did I get an error KeyError: 'user_email'?
A: The error occurred because I mistakenly referred to a column 'user_email' which didn't exist in the dataset. It should have been the user input email instead of referencing the column.
6. Q: How do I classify the user input email?
A: The user input email is vectorized using the same CountVectorizer and then passed to the trained model for prediction. The result is displayed as either "spam" or "ham."
